# Recommender-Systems-with-Python
This project was part of Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp on Udemy by Jose Portilla. 

The main goal of the project is to learn and apply a simple content based recommender system using python. Here below is the project description in detail:

# Recommender Systems with Python

In this project we will develop basic recommendation systems using Python and pandas. 

In this notebook, we will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. Keep in mind, this is not a true robust recommendation system, to describe it more accurately,it just tells you what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice.
